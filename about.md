# About Me

Hello! My name is **Serra** and this website was created as part of **Assignment 1**.

I am currently learning:

- Web development  
- Git & GitHub  
- Scripting  
- Front-end basics  
- Markdown and GitHub Pages  

This website includes 5 pages:

- Home  
- About  
- Projects  
- Blog  
- Contact  

Each page is created using **Markdown** and published with **GitHub Pages** and **Jekyll**.
